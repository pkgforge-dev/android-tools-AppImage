# android-tools-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of Android Platform Tools (adb, fastboot, etc), uses the official [binaries](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) and turns them into an AppImage.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i android-tools` or `appman -i android-tools`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install android-tools.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install android-tools`

This appimage works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)
